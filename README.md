# 11-Project-Hardcoded_AI

This is my final "normal" Project.
It ends with what I consider a Hardcoded AI.
Considering that I want to learn python just because of machine learning I thought that this was a fitting end.
Basicly its a simple program that gives an answer based around the amount of people that live in france and germany using selfmade hard noted data.
